      <img src="./assets/images/HEADSHOT.JPG"class="auth-image" alt="dennis">

      <p>I have always had a passion for IT and computers. It is a field that has always greatly interested me. There are so many fascinating things to be done with computers, and I am very exciting to see where all this technology will take us in the future. And i stronly believe the best is yet to come</p>
      <p>Coding is another great interest of mine. I believe with lots of practice, I can be a very skilled and detailed coder.Some non-IT hobbies of mine include dancing, playing basketball, reading, writing poetry, and working on my crime-thriller novel, The Mysteries of Crafty Dan.</p>
      <p>I also have a background in Electrical Engineering and Radio Frequency Engineering, and looking forward to creating productive applications. </p>
