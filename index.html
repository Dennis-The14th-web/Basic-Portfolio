            <p id="page">Hello world! My name is Dennis, and it is a pleasure to meet you. 
    
            I have always had a passion for IT and computers. It is a field that has always greatly interested me. There are so many fascinating things to be done with computers, and I am very exciting to see where all this technology will take us in the future. </p>
    
            <p id="page">Coding is another great interest of mine. I believe with lots of practice, I can be a very skilled and detailed coder.
                            
            Some non-IT hobbies of mine include dancing, playing basketball, reading, writing poetry, and working on my crime-thriller novel, The Mysteries of Crafty Dan. 
            
            I also have a background in Electrical Engineering and Radio Frequency Engineering, and looking forward to creating productive applications. </p>
